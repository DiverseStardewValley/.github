Thank you for your interest in contributing to the Diverse Stardew Valley
project! If you haven't already done so, please take a couple of minutes to read
through our [code of conduct](code_of_conduct.md) and make sure you
wholeheartedly agree to abide by it. üíñ

## Connecting with Us

Anyone is welcome to join
[our Discord server](https://discordapp.com/invite/gYBJ9sc)! Please read through
the `#welcome` channel and introduce yourself in the `#general-store`. ü§ù

If you'd like to join the
[DSV team](https://github.com/orgs/DiverseStardewValley/people), we ask that you
show us an example of your work after being active in our Discord server for
long enough to reach **Supporter** status. We welcome people of all skill
levels - if you're an expert, that's awesome! And if you're just starting out,
that's cool too! This project is a great place to practice and learn more about
Stardew Valley modmaking.

## Asset Use Permissions

Usage of any DSV art assets, including partial or full portrait art, sprite art,
character designs, and outfit designs, is **strictly forbidden without
permission from the original artist**. DSV assets are **not** allowed to be used
in NSFW or 18+ projects. If you cannot contact an artist, that artist's work
**cannot** be used. Refer to the
[DSV Credits](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/10e0GPMcKTrzAm93Uhn17ElejMpiuwxh2t-utQvrR66M/)
spreadsheet for credit and contact details.

If you are interested in creating a [DSV additional character pack](https://diversestardewvalley.weebly.com/additional-packs.html)
by adapting DSV's seasonal and/or festival outfits by adapting DSV's seasonal
& festival outfits either to another portrait or sprite mod or to your own
portrait or sprite edits, you do not need to ask permission from the individual
DSV asset artists. You do however need to ask permission from the other portrait
artist(s) if adapting an existing portrait mod not made by yourself.

Adapted portrait and sprite mods using DSV assets **cannot be uploaded
separately**. Once you have received permission, please contact Airyn on Discord
and send the assets to be uploaded. Add-on packs will be maintained by the
DSV team and updated to match new features from the main DSV mod at the team's
discretion. We also welcome any users who would like to update additional packs themselves.
