## Prerequisites

In order for DSV to work, you must also have the following two mods installed:

- [**SMAPI**](https://www.nexusmods.com/stardewvalley/mods/2400) - The mod
  loader for Stardew Valley. It launches the game with mod support and lets mods
  interact directly with the game code. It's safely installed alongside your
  normal game, and you can uninstall it anytime if you decide you no longer want
  to play with mods.

  If you have not installed SMAPI before, there are detailed instructions in the
  ["Modding" section of the Stardew Valley Wiki](https://stardewvalleywiki.com/Modding:Player_Guide/Getting_Started#Getting_started)
  to help you get started on any of the officially-supported platforms.

- [**Content Patcher**](https://www.nexusmods.com/stardewvalley/mods/1915) - A
  mod framework that allows sprites and portraits to be dynamically changed
  in-game without replacing any game files.

### Compatibility

See the
[compatibility page](https://diversestardewvalley.weebly.com/compatibility.html)
on our website for an extensive list of other mods that are compatible (and a
few that are incompatible) with DSV.

## Installation

After you've made sure you have both SMAPI and CP installed, you can
[download the Diverse Stardew Valley pack(s)](https://diversestardewvalley.weebly.com/downloads.html)
that you'd like to use.

Each pack comes as a compressed `.zip` file - you'll need to unzip it by
right-clicking (or if you're on Android, long-pressing) it and selecting the
option that looks like "Extract" or "Uncompress". Once that's done, open up the
new unzipped folder, and you should see another folder inside named something
like **"[CP] DSV - [Character Names]"**.

Next, you'll want to locate the `Mods` subfolder inside your
[Stardew Valley game folder](https://stardewvalleywiki.com/Modding:Player_Guide/Getting_Started#Find_your_game_folder).

- To **install** a DSV pack, simply move the **"[CP] DSV - [Character Names]"**
  folder into your `Mods` folder.

- To **uninstall** a DSV pack, move the **"[CP] DSV - [Character Names]"**
  folder out of your `Mods` folder (or just delete it).

- To **update** a DSV pack, it's often easiest to uninstall your existing
  version of that pack before downloading and installing the newest version.
  (You can move the `config.json` from the old **"[CP] DSV - [Character
  Names]"** folder into the new one to preserve your settings.)

### Vortex

We do **not** recommend using Vortex to install Diverse Stardew Valley (or any
other SDV mods, for that matter). Vortex sometimes fails to correctly remove old
files when updating or removing mods, which can cause issues that are difficult
to troubleshoot. Thanks to SMAPI and Content Patcher, SDV mods are very easy to
manually install/uninstall.
