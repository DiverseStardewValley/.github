# Diverse Stardew Valley

Diverse Stardew Valley edits the villagers of Pelican Town to add ethnic,
cultural, gender identity and body type diversity and unique seasonal and
festival outfits for both the vanilla and the alternate diverse character
designs.

The Diverse Stardew Valley project was started by notsnufffie, and is now being
continued by the community. The art and coding of this mod was made by the DSV
Team with the help of many generous contributors.
**[Here is a complete spreadsheet of DSV's credits!](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/10e0GPMcKTrzAm93Uhn17ElejMpiuwxh2t-utQvrR66M/edit#gid=5373728)**
